 🧠 How the Quiz Works

1. The game starts with a welcome message.
2. Questions are loaded and shuffled randomly.
3. For each question:

   * The question and four options are displayed.
   * A **10-second countdown** runs.
   * User enters answer (A/B/C/D).
   * Answer is checked and score is updated.
4. After all questions, the final score is shown.
